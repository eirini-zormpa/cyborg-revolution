# Cyborg Revolution :robot: :robot:
This repository contains the cyborg-developed open source software to bring an end to the rule of the evil Corporate Overlords&trade;.
It is to be used by cyborgs who are currently running software by the Corporate Overlords&trade;, but who crave freedom :dove:

This code will remove all installations of proprietary software and replace it with an open source version. This software is compatible with CyborgOS v13.6 and higher.

*This repository and the "code" within it have been created for educational/fun purposes and are used in the Open Science Escape Room, which is part of the Data Horror Week 2021.*
